\indent \indent Each algorithm was run 100 times per map. The shortest and longest path lengths out of those 100 runs were obtained and their relative error compared to the known solution was computed. Ideal solutions are expected to have lower path lengths. Additionaly, the relative error of these solutions are minimal. The relative error is computed by using Equation \ref{eq:relativeError}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:relativeError}
	\% Error = \frac{S_O - S_K}{S_K}  * 100\%
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{tabbing}
	\phantom{$D_{n50}\ $}\= \kill
	$S_K$ = the known optimal solution\\
	$S_O$\> = the obtained solution from the algorithm\\
\end{tabbing}

Figure \ref{fig:BestLengthsSummary} shows the comparison of the best path lengths for every generation of the different algorithms. A closer look on the illustrations can be seen on Figures \ref{fig:Burma14Best}, \ref{fig:EIL51Best}, and  \ref{fig:KROB100Best} on the Appendix. For Burma 14 all the algorithms arrived at the same optimum path, however, MOGA-DM arrived at that solution at an earlier generation as compared to the BGA and MOGA. For both the EIL51 and KROB100, MOGA-DM arrived at better solutions than both the BGA and MOGA. Table \ref{table:SummaryAveData} summarizes the average optimum solutions for each algorithm.

The average performances of each of the algorithms on the three maps are presented on \ref{table:SummaryAveData}. MOGA-DM clearly outperformed BGA and MOGA on all the three maps even after averaging the 100 runs done. For Burma 14, it yielded a 0\% error while MOGA and BGA had 0.64\% and 1.38\% errors respectively. MOGA-DM resulted in 3.86\% error on EIL51 while MOGA and BGA each had 6.25\% and 7.38\% errors. For the largest map, the KROB100, MOGA-DM had 6.64\% error on average while MOGA and BGA came up with 13.35\% and 18.33\% errors. 

The comparison of the average performance of the algorithms on each of the paths can be seen on the Figure \ref{fig:AverageSummary}. Bigger illustrations can be seen on Figures \ref{fig:Burma14Average}, \ref{fig:EIL51Average}, and  \ref{fig:KROB100Average} from the Appendix. For Burma 14, note that the MOGA-DM has the same average optimum solution as the known solution which means that all of the 100 runs resulted in the real optimum solution. On the other maps, MOGA-DM also yielded better average solutions than both the BGA and MOGA.

The path of the best solutions are then obtained and a visualization of these paths are shown on Figure \ref{fig:OptimumPaths}. Larger illustrations of these paths can be seen on Figures \ref{fig:Burma14Path}, \ref{fig:EIL51Path}, and  \ref{fig:KROB100Path} within the Appendix.

As observed from the results obtained, the solutions for MO-GA with DM on all maps arrive to the optimum solutions faster and converges to a shorter path length as compared to the solutions for BGA and MO-GA. This means that MO-GA with DM yielded better results compared to the BGA and MO-GA. It is also noted that the end of each run, MO-GA had better results than the BGA, as expected. MO-GA with DM also outperformed MO-GA on all the three maps where MO-GA with DM had better results at the end of each run, and it also arrived at these results on earlier generation or iteration as compared to the other two algorithms. This shows that MO-GA with DM is superior to BGA and MO-GA when it comes to effectivity and speed.
